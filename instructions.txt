 Battleships! Is a python driven game based on the classic  
 battleships boardgame.  
 The aim of the game is to sink all the enemy ships before yours  
 are sunk. After your choice of game board size, the game will  
 randomly place your ships on your board and these positions are  
 displayed to you.  
 4 = Battleship  
 3 = Cruiser  
 2 = Destroyer  
 1 = Submarine  
 You will then have the option to choose where you will fire on  
 the enemies board. This must be entered with a captial letter to  
 select the row, and a number to select the column, as you would  
 with map coordinates. These two characters must be separated by  
 a comma. Eg. A,4.  
 The game will tell you if you have hit or missed the computers  
 ships, and your shots will be displayed on a separate board for  
 you to view. An X represents a missed hit, a H represents a hit  
 After each of your shots, the computer will return fire, if they  
 hit/miss you this will be displayed with X/H, with messages from  
 the game to confirm this. Keep firing until you have sunk all  
 the computers ships or they have sunk yours.  
 Good luck Captain!
